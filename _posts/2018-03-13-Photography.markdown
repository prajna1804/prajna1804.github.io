Photography is something that gives me the freedom to express myself and show the world from my own perspective !
There is always a scope to improve your skill when it comes to photography which i love !
I recently started learning photography in SOD and i am in love with it.
I truly want to continue with it and fill this blog up with all my cherished pictures.
