Travelling !
Travelling is something most people enjoy. It is not just the journey but the experiences you build !
you can interact with various kinds of people and get introduced to various cultures.. and lets not forget about the various kinds of food you get to eat ! well that people live for! Do you enjoy travelling like me ? Which is the place you have visited which will stay with you for ever in the form of memories? Each trip i take i form many memories i cherish so much !

In School Of Design I had an assignment where i had to make two types of magazine layouts related to a place and my travelling adventures surely helped me !
I choose Australia for my assignment ! What would you have choose?

Most of the time breaking the grid is a good thing! and is definitely fun!

But other times sticking to the grid is important.
