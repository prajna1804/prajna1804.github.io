I had to make 2 social cause posters for two different user groups as an assignment in SOD.
I choose the social problem of Killing of Girl child.
I first did desk research to find out more about the problem and where it was still prevalent.
I collected my data and analysed it well.
I then figured out what i wanted to show in my posters and sketched out all of my ideas.
I made the ideas i liked the best as a bigger sketch with colour added.
I then did user testing by asking my target user group questions about my posters.
I made changes where ever required after user testing and it was ready for my submission.
