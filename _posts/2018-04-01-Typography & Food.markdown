To me food is a very important part of life .. I mean come on who can hate food! Likewise i also love typography it takes skill and practice to master and is not as easy as it seems.
When i came to know that you can even learn typography through food u can imagine my excitement and joy..
Food helping me learn... just gave me another reason to love both!

We had an assignment in typography where we had to take any dry food and scatter it on a piece of paper.
We then had to use those scattered pieces of food and study the weights of type.
We ad to match the weight of the food to the type.It was an amazing learning experience along with being fun !

This was the first step of the process:

It went on to become this:

At the end this is how it turned up to be.
