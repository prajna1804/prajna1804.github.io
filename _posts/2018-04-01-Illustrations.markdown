I learnt how to use Adobe Illustrator when I joint NMIMS and I am so happy that I did.
It is such an amazing way of illustrating and i often just go and start making random illustrations and exploring.
It helps me relax and calms me down.

Here are some examples of illustrations i have made for assignments and also for relaxing.

This one is for one of our early illustration assignments where i was still figuring out Illustrator.

This one i made for my cultural narrative assignment.

These two i made at home by referring to the net and  changing them and making them my own versions.
